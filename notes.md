During my first runthrough of coding the projects and help command I made a function to create the line of tags I wanted then another function which populated the tags, this made it so I could have some words in the line have different css than others. This was becoming too complex. I then restarted the idea making the function more streamlined and hardcoded in. This made the code a lot more readable and easy to manipulate. However this was becoming too laborous and I would need to hard code every function in. While reading thorugh some stuff about css, I realized I can use css to do the animations so I wouldnt need to play with SetTimeouts to slowly add a letter every some seconds. This also allowed me to just put in the line I wanted to add, with tags and all, and have the css take care of the animation.
This made the process a lot simplier and easier as a whole.
